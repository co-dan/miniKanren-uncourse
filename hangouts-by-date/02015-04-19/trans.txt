setup: player is in a room that has a painting on the wall


logic: can the player see the painting?

by default, the player can see the painting, if the player is in the same room as the painting

unless...

the lights are out [<- electricity failure]

unless...

they have a flashlight, in which case can they can the painting

unless...

they have no batteries

or

the batteries are dead




player has lost their eyes or their glasses or the player is blindfolded or the player is invisible or hidden or there is smoke in the room

A -> B  regular implication
B ~> C  defeasible (defeatable) implication


player-in-room -> can-see-painting
lights-out -> !can-see-painting



player-in-room ~> can-see-painting [1]
lights-out [defeats 1]




player-in-room ~> can-see-painting [1]
lights-out ~> !can-see-painting [2, defeats 1]
has-flashlight ~> can-see-painting [3, defeats 2]

A -> B, B -> C

If X is a bird, and X is not a penguin, then X can fly.
chilly is a bird


flies(X) :- bird(X), \+ penguin(X).
bird(chilly).

?- flies(chilly)
YES

penguin(chilly).

?- flies(chilly)
NO

non-monotonic logic

Linear logic: logic of resources or state
useful for encoding the inventory, for example



$1

<transaction: exchange $1 for slice of pizza>

slice-of-pizza
